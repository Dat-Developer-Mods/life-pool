# Hardcore Life Pool
A minecraft datapack to add a shared player lifepool to hardcore servers.

This simple datapack respawns players after they die in hardcore. When a player repsawns, they consume one of
the lives in the life pool, of which is shared by all the players on the server. When all the lives run out,
it's game over, and every player is set to spectator.
